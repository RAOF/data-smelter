Rust library for interacting with Linux vfs hot-data interface

Incomplete, evolving in parallel with the kernel patches in raof/linux, and is also my vehicle for learning Rust. Feel free to point out better coding idioms!

The goal is that this ends up being a userspace daemon to migrate hot data to fast storage in a heterogeneous drive btrfs filesystem.
